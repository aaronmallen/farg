# Process Documentation

This directory contains documentation for project processes and workflows.

## Overview

Use these processes to propose and document significant changes:

- **RFC (Request for Comments)**: Use *before* implementing a feature to gather feedback and build consensus
- **ADR (Architecture Decision Record)**: Use *after* making a decision to document the rationale for future reference

## Which Process Should I Use?

| Scenario                                        | Process |

| Proposing a new feature or API change           | RFC     |
| Discussing trade-offs before committing         | RFC     |
| Documenting why we chose approach A over B      | ADR     |
| Recording a convention or pattern for the repo  | ADR     |
| Major refactoring that needs team input         | RFC     |
| Explaining historical context for a design      | ADR     |
